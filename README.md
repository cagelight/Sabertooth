Sabertooth
==========
Solution file for Project Sabertooth. Requires Sabertooth, Sabertooth Lexicon, WebSharp, and at least one Mandate:
https://gist.github.com/Kallikrates/6877903

Mandates are .sbr and .cs files placed in a "Sites" folder located where the executable and dlls are located. They will be compiled at runtime, and consistently checked for updates and recompiled as needed.

<Insert instructions on how to create mandates here (I'll do it eventually)>
